# MATLAB automatic differentiation

Complex reverse mode automatic differentiation for MATLAB

Supports basic functions and image processing oriented functions : Fourier transform, Image cropping, Radon transform etc...

Implementation of the optimizer FISTA ADAM NADAM ADAMAX NADAMAX

Go to **_AUTODIFF/exemple/FISTA_example.m** for a phase retrieval example using FISTA optimization

Based on https://github.com/LKedward/madiff and github.com/gaika/madiff with added complex support, multidimention support, lower memory, optimizer and more functions.
